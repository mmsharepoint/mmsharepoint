I work at Avanade in Germany as a Manager and an expert for Microsoft 365 Development. 

I continuously contribute to the [Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) community where my main focus is to produce Microsoft Teams app samples, but not only. I am also a [member of the core team](https://pnp.github.io/#team) there.
